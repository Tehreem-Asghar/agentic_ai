# OpenAI Agents SDK - Simple Overview

## What is OpenAI Agents SDK?

OpenAI Agents SDK is a Python-based framework designed to help developers build AI agents that can autonomously perform complex, multi-step tasks. It enables multiple AI agents to work together seamlessly, using tools and safety checks, to solve real-world problems efficiently.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Agents**: AI language models preconfigured with instructions and access to tools like web search or file retrieval. Agents generate responses and decide which tools to use based on the situation.

- **Handoffs**: If an agent cannot handle a task, it can hand it off to another specialized agent to ensure smooth task completion.

- **Guardrails**: Built-in safety checks that validate inputs and outputs, ensuring agents operate safely within defined limits.

- **Tracing & Observability**: Integrated tracing tools help developers visualize and debug the agent workflows for better monitoring and performance optimization.

## Key Features

- **Python-First Design**: Easy to use for Python developers with minimal learning curve.

- **Built-in Agent Loop**: Automates the process of sending prompts, invoking tools, handling agent handoffs, and generating final outputs.

- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Supports complex systems where multiple agents collaborate, each handling different parts of a task.

- **Interoperability**: Compatible with OpenAI models and any other model provider supporting the Chat Completions API.

## Important Classes and Concepts

- **Agent Class**: A `@dataclass` containing instructions (system prompts), which can also be dynamic functions (callables).

- **Runner Class**: Executes agents with user inputs and manages tool calls and agent coordination through a `run()` class method.

- **Generics (TContext)**: Used to ensure type safety and reusability in the SDKâ€™s design.
